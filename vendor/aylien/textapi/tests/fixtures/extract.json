      "title": "The Super-Slim Kindle Voyage Is A Great Travel Companion",
      "article": "In 1935, Sir Allen Lane and V. K. Krishna Menon founded Penguin Books, a company dedicated to producing high-quality, small-format paperback books for the world market. These small, well-made little books introduced some amazing fiction, philosophy, classical thought and spiritualism to a hungry audience, and the low price made it easy to build a library of amazing titles that could fit into a milk crate. Penguin, it can be argued, brought about an intellectual sea change, bringing us both the post-war writers of note and, in another direction, the Beats and the spiritual riot of the 1960s.\n\nWhy was Penguin so popular? And why is the 6-inch Kindle Voyage its emotional successor? Both revolutionized the physical notion of books.\n\nIn Penguin\u2019s case, the medium was truly the message, and\u00a0the writing inside the small, pocketable books allowed for portability and encouraged collection. In the Kindle Voyage\u2019s case, Amazon has created a delightful travel companion.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the size. The $199 Voyage ($219 without ads and with 3G) is about as big as a Penguin paperback and just a bit bigger (and thicker) than a standard passport. It\u2019s 7.6 mm thick and removed from its case it looks about as substantial as a thin stack of paper.\n\nThe Voyage is the Kindle distilled. Almost all of the features are there \u2013 touchscreen, bright white e-ink display, and even a special haptic feedback system that allows you to \u201cclick\u201d left and right side buttons to turn pages. You can also swipe the page left and right to move to the next page and small dedicated spots above the longer touch-sensitive pads that go back one page.\n\nAmazon sells an $45 folding case for the Voyage that opens up like a Moleskine reporter\u2019s notebook. It activates the Kindle upon opening and turns it off when closed. Hidden magnets then allow you to turn the cover into a little stand for hands-free reading.\n\nSo how does it work? In short, I love e-ink devices, and the Voyage is the best of them. Because it lasts for weeks \u2013 I haven\u2019t charged it in a full week of use \u2013 you can stick it in a bag or backpack and expect it to be ready to read. The bright backlit screen casts a gentle glow that is reactive to outside light and makes reading pleasant without the glare of LCD. As a dedicated e-reader, it is nearly perfect, and I rarely say anything in CE is perfect.\n\nWho is this for? It\u2019s for readers. The Voyage doesn\u2019t do much except display books and allow you to buy them. You can download thousands of titles and not run out of space and, thanks to new organizational systems, you can place books into folders and control their placement on the device. But, again, it\u2019s for readers. Don\u2019t expect to read email, browse the web, or control your home security system from this device. It\u2019s the e-reader perfected, however, and that means a lot.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much longer the market for dedicated e-readers will exist, but I certainly appreciate Amazon\u2019s dedication to the cause. E-ink devices are special because they\u2019re amazingly readable and light and have great battery life. All of these aspects work in concert to offer a reading experience akin to thumbing through a Penguin Classic.\n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s great for travel \u2013 I took it with me to Disrupt in Europe and have read it on planes for the past few days \u2013 and it\u2019s great for people who don\u2019t want a distracting reading experience. It\u2019s a great gateway tablet, for example, for folks who don\u2019t want a complex experience and instead just want to read. It\u2019s also far more comfortable on the eyes for night reading in bed and the text can be modified for any eyes.\n\nAmazon is aiming for readers. It knows that people love Kindles because they are pure products for reading. And the Voyage is Amazon\u2019s latest attempt at perfecting the e-book. Not unlike Penguin, Amazon looked at the market and made a bold move. It\u2019s paid off and the resulting products \u2013 the Fire like and this new Kindle \u2013 are nearly perfect media consumption devices by a company that knows how to sell.",

      "title": "Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai: New centre of the sporting world?",
      "article": "Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai: New centre of the sporting world?\n\nWhere once, sport looked west for investment and inspiration, now it looks east.\n\nThe oil-rich billionaires of the Gulf have planted a flag at the heart of the sporting landscape in recent years. They have invested their inconceivable wealth across an array of sports into all corners of the world and now they are using their influence to bring sport to the region, as a global statement of their ambition.\n\nThree Gulf states are at the heart of this extraordinary revolution: Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. In Dubai alone, you will find one billionaire in every 200,000 people.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, a rival state in the United Arab Emirates, the figures are just as extraordinary. It is in the process of building the jaw-dropping having paid the world-famous Paris museum more than \u00a3400m just to use the name. While in Qatar, more than 14% of households have at least \u00a31m of private wealth in the bank.\n\nAnd it is that wealth, that influence, which has lured sport to the Gulf.\n\nTake last week, for instance. On Monday, the row over Qatar's right to stage the 2022 World Cup rumbled on. On Tuesday, Doha in Qatar won the right to host the 2019 World Athletics Championships. From Thursday to Sunday, Rory McIlroy duelled with Henrik Stenson at the European Tour's season-ending showpiece in Dubai.\n\nLewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and the rest of the Formula 1 circus were in Abu Dhabi from Thursday before contesting the final Grand Prix of the season on Sunday at the ostentatious Yas Marina Circuit, built at a cost of about \u00a3900m ($1.5bn).\n\nThe region is fast becoming a sporting hub like no other. Qatar, for example, will host world championships in boxing, swimming, squash, handball and para-athletics in the next 12 months as well as staging almost 40 other sporting events.\n\nThe question is why? Dr Christopher Davidson, reader in Middle East studies at Durham University, says the approach is all about increasing global exposure.\n\n\"One of the key reasons behind the approach is the desire to accumulate 'soft power' in states which are either major trade partners or, more importantly, potential military protectors, notably the UK, France and the United States,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"If sport is a way to allow these Gulf states to grab favourable headlines and become better known, then it can help them to appear more open, more friendly.\"\n\nIf we look at each of the three states individually, the picture is easier to understand.\n\nDubai has the longest association with sport thanks to its supreme ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The 65-year-old is best known as owner of Godolphin, the thoroughbred horse racing group, which he founded in 1994.\n\nIn 1996, the Dubai World Cup was inaugurated as the world's richest horserace and takes place at the world's most opulent course, the Meydan, built at a cost of \u00a3800m ($1.25bn).\n\nSheikh Mohammed's private wealth is estimated at \u00a39bn, but his reach extends far beyond that. He founded Emirates Airways, which last year\n\nThey have shirt deals with Italy's AC Milan, French club Paris St-Germain and Arsenal, whose north London stadium will be named after the airline until at least 2028. But they also have deals with the US Open tennis, the International Cricket Council, the Ryder Cup and the USA Rugby Union team.\n\nKevin Hasler, general manager of PR firm BPG, Cohn & Wolfe, said: \"When you watch a Premier League game and the commentator says 'here at the Etihad' or 'their third successive win at the Emirates', naming stadiums and shirt sponsorship has become enormously effective.\n\n\"Brands are being seen around the world in newspapers and on TV, day in, day out. The core of these strategies is about investing to put these states on the map, getting them talked about and discussed.\"\n\nElsewhere, Dubai has hosted an ATP Tennis event at the Aviation Club with Roger Federer, who has a home in the region, winning four times in five years from 2003 and a sixth time this year.\n\nThere was, of course, that ill-fated attempt to buy Liverpool in 2007 and 2008.\n\nAbu Dhabi has, however, gone one step further. If Dubai has Emirates Airways, Abu Dhabi has Etihad - a name synonymous with the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.\n\nAbu Dhabi is ruled by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. His half brother, Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan bin Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan (better known as Sheikh Mansour) is the man who bought Manchester City in 2008.\n\nThe family have ruled the emirate since the 18th century and pride themselves on 'respect for heritage, culture, tradition.'\n\nThe ruling family are complex with Sheikh Mansour one of 19 sons born to Abu Dhabi's long-term ruler Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. His mother, one of six wives, had six sons, making her part of this vast family the most influential.\n\nIn terms of wealth? It is almost limitless. It is estimated that the family have as much as $1tn in overseas assets alone. Their investment in City represents loose change, in relative terms, even if they have pumped in excess of \u00a31bn into the club since 2008.\n\nTheir football interests extend elsewhere, however. A company owned by Sheikh Mansour has recently agreed to to the tune of \u00a3312m.\n\nThe work will include the creation of a hotel and shopping centre. But perhaps it is their move to expand into the United States that is more interesting.\n\nIn 2013, Major League Soccer and the iconic New York Yankees announced a pioneering deal to create an MLS franchise in New York in time for the start of the 2015-16 season -\n\nIt is a development that could give Abu Dhabi a footing and profile in the United States that was previously unimaginable. A few months later, it was announced Sheikh Mansour and Manchester City added Australian side Melbourne Heart.\n\n\"You could look at things like the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the Abu Dhabi golf championships and the investment in Manchester City as some of their most prominent global marketing assets,\" said Ben Faber, senior director at Fast Track Middle East, the company tasked with delivering City's fan loyalty programmes.\n\n\"The Manchester City investment has given the emirate global awareness through the fan base and they have been able to tap into associated Abu Dhabi businesses such as Etihad to leverage off the back of that ownership as sponsors of the club.\"\n\nAnd what of Qatar? Financial experts describe it as the world's most ambitious deal hunter. A brief scan across the London skyline would suggest they have a point.\n\nThe Shard, is Qatari owned, as are swathes of the Canary Wharf financial district.\n\nDuring the financial crisis, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) emerged as a white-knight investor to become Barclays' biggest shareholder. A little further east, many of the buildings in the Olympic Village are now owned by QIA.\n\nThe world's most expensive block of flats, is Qatar owned as is Harrods, the famous department store. It owns a fifth of the London stock exchange, 20% of Camden market. The reach is extraordinary.\n\nQatar is ruled by a 34-year-old Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the world's youngest reigning monarch. Born in Doha, the capital of Qatar, he was educated at Harrow School in London, before graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He is now head of the QIA, which is estimated to have assets of \u00a3300bn.\n\nQuestions remain about the bidding process for the 2022 World Cup and world governing body Fifa has yet to fully address the plight of the 1.4m migrant workers in the country, many of whom are there against their will.\n\nThe project began just after the turn of the century, when some of Europe's elder footballing statesmen were lured to Qatar for one last pay day. Pep Guardiola was among them, playing for Al Ahli between 2003 and 2005.\n\nThe Bayern Munich manager subsequently became an ambassador for Qatar's successful World Cup bid. But there was more to come. Some 10 days after Fifa announced the country would host the World Cup in 2022, came the news that Qatar would appear on the Barcelona shirt, in a deal that would become the biggest in football sponsorship history.\n\nThe deal was struck with the Qatar Foundation, the country's charitable arm. Two years later, Qatar Airways' paid \u00a376m (\u20ac96m) to extend the country's sponsorship to all areas of the club.\n\nThen in 2011, QIA bought Paris St-Germain. It was a bold move to harness the potential of the biggest one-club city in Europe. To aid their cause PSG signed a controversial \u20ac200m-a-year sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority. Paris is not the only city in Europe touched by the wealth of Qatar. A year earlier, Sheikh Abdullah Al-Thani, of the country's Royal Family, bought the Spanish club Malaga.\n\nQatar's wealth is built on having the world's third-largest natural gas reserves. But they will not last forever. \"By bringing sport to the Gulf, these states are not only helping to boost tourism, boosting GDP as a result, but they are also reducing their reliance on the oil, gas or industry that may not last forever,\" said Dr Davidson.\n\nAnd yet while the region brings opportunity and wealth it also brings with it controversy. The climate does not suit all sport at all times. The row about when to stage the 2022 World Cup is well publicised. Qatar is also moving the 2019 World Athletics Championships to the autumn because of the unbearable summer heat.\n\nAnd that is to say nothing of conditions for migrant workers, who often have to surrender the passports and whose right to come and go is governed by their employer.\n\nIn September two British researchers documenting the problems faced by migrant workers were held for 10 days without charge. In Dubai, the former Leeds United managing director David Haigh has been in prison for six months without charge.\n\nAnd yet these issues are being overlooked. Money talks. As does the opportunity to take sport to new parts of the world.\n\nWill these states continue to bankroll sport, continue to build their sport portfolios?\n\nNo one can be certain of the answer. Doha has twice bid for the Olympic Games but they are unlikely to be put off bidding again. Who would bet against them?\n\nThere are, however, those who believe that the region's investment focus is shifting towards cultural and artistic assets. In 2017, construction is due to be complete on a based on the original in New York.\n\nBut having secured such a stronghold in sport, their existing investments will remain a key part of each respective state's marketing strategies. The wealth is limitless, the ambition to bring the best athletes in the world to the region remains.\n\nIt is a land grab unmatched anywhere in the world. In sporting terms, east has met west.",
